      79% of Internet of Things (IoT) app developers spend at least 25% of their
      time with analytics or databases, and 42% work on Big Data or advanced
      analytics projects. 55% of IoT developers primarily connect devices
      through the Cloud, with 32% connecting through a hub or middle tier.

  In Part 1 of this series, we introduced you to the Internet of Things (IoT)
  Foundation service in Bluemix and how it connects an IoT device to the cloud,
  enabling it to leverage the wealth of available cloud services. But we also
  posed a difficult question: What happens if you're really successful and 100K+
  devices want to connect?
